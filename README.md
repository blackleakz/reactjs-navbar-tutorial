Description:

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create a ReactJS Application with a customized NavigationBar using bootstrap-overrides!


Requirements:
Node.JS - https://nodejs.org/de/download
NPM - (linux : install npm by your package-manager! / windows: npm should be installed through the nodejs installation!)
An Integrated Desktop Enviroment like Visual Studio Code would be awesome, but if you want to , you can use a texteditor + a terminal for crafting this app! If you dont want to use both, you can fork the codesandbox - repository and edit the code in your browser! ;)
